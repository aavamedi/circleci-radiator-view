# Simple build status radiator view

Many continuous integration services lack a nice and simple radiator view / dashboard.
This project simply displays all your projects and selected branches with status based coloring.

Supported backends are [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and
[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io).

_Pull requests are welcome._

## Setup for CircleCI

1. Get your API token from [your CirleCI account settings](https://circleci.com/account/api)
2. Open `index.html`

## Setup for Travis CI

1. Get your API token from (https://travis-ci.org/profile/<your_profile>)
2. Open `index.html?mode=travis`

## Setup for Jenkins

1. Create a user and a token for the user in your job settings
2. Open `index.html?mode=jenkins` and add the job end point URL (eg. http://host/jenkins/job/My%20Job)

## Query parameters

All options can be set either with a query parameter or from the setup form, which is shown when
any required parameters are missing.

- mode

  select backend to use, _circle_ (default), _travis_ or _jenkins_

- branch

  Select the branch to show (from all repos found in the API end point).
  Useful if your repos contain only a single branch (master, release etc) that should be visible
  in the radiator view.

- token

  The auth token token to use. NOTE: CirleCI API tokens have read and write access. When you
  use the query parameter, the token is visible in your browser history.

- url

  Only for jenkins, really: the Jenkins job URL

Example with all parameters in use:

https://yourdomain.com/?mode=circle&branch=release&token=835li2ixxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx1sd41

Example where the token is entered in an input field:

https://yourdomain.com/?mode=travis&branch=master

Jenkins example:

https://yourdomain.com/?mode=jenkins&token=jenkins_token&url=http://localhost:8080/jenkins/job/My%20Job
